# Employee Management System

## Overview

The **Employee Management System** is a web-based application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows administrators to create, view, update, and delete employee details. The system includes functionality for employee management with image upload (in Base64 format), authentication, search, and a responsive user interface.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Secure login and logout for admins to manage the employee database.
- **Employee Management**: 
  - Add new employees with details such as name, email, mobile number, designation, gender, and profile image.
  - View a list of all employees.
  - Edit existing employee details.
  - Delete employee records.
- **Search and Filter**: Search employees by name or email with a dynamic search bar.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and works well across different devices.
- **Image Upload**: Employees can upload their profile image, stored in the database using Base64 encoding.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure that Node.js is installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MongoDB**: Ensure that MongoDB is running locally or use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-based solution.
